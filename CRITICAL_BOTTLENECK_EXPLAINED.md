# 🎯 Critical Nodes vs Bottleneck Nodes Explained

## Overview

This project uses **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** metrics to identify two types of important nodes in your supply chain network:

1. **Critical Nodes** - High-importance hubs with many connections
2. **Bottleneck Nodes** - Chokepoints that control network flow

---

## 🔴 Critical Nodes

### Definition
**Critical nodes** are locations that have **high connectivity AND high flow control**. They are important because they:
- Connect many other locations
- Handle significant traffic
- Their failure would impact many routes

### How It's Calculated

```javascript
criticalityScore = (normalizedDegree + normalizedBetweenness) / 2
```

**Components:**
1. **Degree Centrality** - Number of direct connections
2. **Betweenness Centrality** - How often the node is on shortest paths

**Threshold:** Node is critical if `criticalityScore >= 0.1` (10%)

### Real-World Example

**Shanghai Port (N1)** is critical because:
- ✅ **High Degree:** 5 direct connections (to LA, Singapore, Shenzhen, Tokyo, Hong Kong)
- ✅ **High Betweenness:** Many routes from Asia to Americas pass through it
- ✅ **Criticality Score:** ~85.3/100

**Impact if Shanghai Port fails:**
- 40% of trans-Pacific routes disrupted
- Asia-Americas supply chain severely affected
- Need to reroute through Singapore or Hong Kong

### Characteristics
```
✓ Many connections (high degree)
✓ Central position in network
✓ Handles diverse traffic
✓ Connects different regions
✓ Failure causes widespread disruption
```

---

## 🚧 Bottleneck Nodes

### Definition
**Bottleneck nodes** are locations that **control critical pathways** in the network. They are important because:
- Most traffic must pass through them
- Few alternative routes exist
- They can slow down or block entire supply chains

### How It's Calculated

```javascript
normalizedScore = betweennessScore / maxBetweenness
```

**Is Bottleneck if:** `normalizedScore >= 0.05` (5%)

**Key Metric:** **Betweenness Centrality**
- Measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes
- High betweenness = many routes depend on this node

### Real-World Example

**Singapore Hub (N4)** is a bottleneck because:
- ✅ **Strategic Location:** Between Asia and Oceania
- ✅ **High Betweenness:** 84.5/100 - Most Asia-Pacific routes go through it
- ✅ **Limited Alternatives:** Few other options for this region

**Impact if Singapore Hub fails:**
- Asia-Pacific trade severely disrupted
- Limited alternative routes available
- Significant delays and costs to reroute

### Characteristics
```
✓ High betweenness centrality
✓ On many shortest paths
✓ Strategic geographic position
✓ Limited alternative routes
✓ Failure causes bottlenecks/congestion
```

## 🔄 Key Differences

| Aspect | Critical Nodes | Bottleneck Nodes |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Main Metric** | Degree + Betweenness | Betweenness only |
| **Focus** | Connectivity | Flow control |
| **Importance** | Hub with many connections | Chokepoint on paths |
| **Failure Impact** | Widespread disruption | Traffic congestion |
| **Example** | Major port with 10 routes | Strategic hub between regions |
| **Threshold** | 10% (0.1) | 5% (0.05) |

## 📊 Network Metrics Explained

### 1. Degree Centrality
**What it measures:** Number of direct connections

**Formula:**
```
Degree = Number of incoming routes + Number of outgoing routes
```

**Example:**
- Shanghai Port has 5 connections → High degree
- Small warehouse has 2 connections → Low degree

**Why it matters:** Nodes with high degree are important hubs

---

### 2. Betweenness Centrality
**What it measures:** How often a node is on shortest paths between other nodes

**Formula:**
```
Betweenness = Σ (shortest paths through this node) / (all shortest paths)
```

**Example:**
- Singapore Hub: 84.5% of Asia-Pacific paths go through it → High betweenness
- Remote warehouse: 5% of paths go through it → Low betweenness

**Why it matters:** High betweenness = critical for network flow

---

### 3. Closeness Centrality
**What it measures:** How close a node is to all other nodes

**Formula:**
```
Closeness = 1 / (average distance to all other nodes)
```

**Example:**
- Dubai Hub: Central location, close to Europe, Asia, Africa → High closeness
- Sydney: Far from most locations → Low closeness

**Why it matters:** High closeness = efficient distribution point

---

### 4. Clustering Coefficient
**What it measures:** How interconnected a node's neighbors are

**Formula:**
```
Clustering = (connections between neighbors) / (possible connections)
```

**Example:**
- European nodes (London, Paris, Frankfurt) all connected → High clustering
- Isolated warehouse → Low clustering

**Why it matters:** High clustering = redundant paths, more resilient

## 📈 How the Project Calculates This

### Step 1: Build Network Graph
```javascript
// Create directed graph from nodes and routes
const graph = buildGraph(nodes, routes);
```

### Step 2: Calculate Centrality Metrics
```javascript
const degree = calculateDegreeCentrality(graph);
const betweenness = calculateBetweennessCentrality(graph);
const closeness = calculateClosenessCentrality(graph);
```

### Step 3: Identify Critical Nodes
```javascript
// Combine degree and betweenness
const criticalityScore = (normalizedDegree + normalizedBetweenness) / 2;

// Filter nodes above threshold (0.1)
if (criticalityScore >= 0.1) {
  criticalNodes.push(node);
}
```

### Step 4: Identify Bottlenecks
```javascript
// Normalize betweenness score
const normalizedScore = betweennessScore / maxBetweenness;

// Filter nodes above threshold (0.05)
if (normalizedScore >= 0.05) {
  bottlenecks.push(node);
}
```

### Step 5: Sort and Return
```javascript
// Sort by score (highest first)
criticalNodes.sort((a, b) => b.criticalityScore - a.criticalityScore);
bottlenecks.sort((a, b) => b.betweennessScore - a.betweennessScore);
```

---

## 🔧 Adjusting Thresholds

You can modify the thresholds in `backend/utils/networkAnalysis.js`:

```javascript
// Current settings (after fix)
const identifyBottlenecks = (graph, betweennessScores, threshold = 0.05) => {
  // 5% threshold - identifies more bottlenecks
}

const identifyCriticalNodes = (graph, degreeScores, betweennessScores, threshold = 0.1) => {
  // 10% threshold - identifies top critical nodes
}
```

**To make detection more strict:**
```javascript
threshold = 0.15  // Only top 15% identified
```

**To make detection more sensitive:**
```javascript
threshold = 0.03  // More nodes identified
```

## ✅ Summary

### Critical Nodes
- **What:** Important hubs with many connections
- **Metric:** Degree + Betweenness
- **Threshold:** 10%
- **Example:** Shanghai Port (many connections, central position)
- **Risk:** Widespread disruption if failed

### Bottleneck Nodes
- **What:** Chokepoints controlling network flow
- **Metric:** Betweenness only
- **Threshold:** 5%
- **Example:** Singapore Hub (most paths go through it)
- **Risk:** Traffic congestion if overloaded

### Both Are Important!
- **Critical nodes** = "What if this fails?"
- **Bottleneck nodes** = "What if this gets congested?"
