## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### No data showing?
```bash
# Check backend logs
cd backend
npm run dev
# Look for "Nodes uploaded: 30" message
```

### Empty charts?
```bash
# Refresh dashboard
Click "Refresh" button
# Or reload page (F5)
```

### Low health score?
```
Expected! Dataset includes:
• 2 disrupted nodes
• 4 disrupted routes
• 11 high-risk routes
This is intentional for testing alerts
```

### Email not working?
```bash
# Check .env configuration
cd backend
cat .env
# Verify EMAIL_* variables are set
```
